PROMPT: Accurate ASL Translation of Quranic Verses

TASK: Translate the following Quranic verse(s) into American Sign Language (ASL) gloss notation that would be suitable for accurate signing.

INPUT FORMAT:
A list of verses from the Quran in English translation.

TRANSLATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. GRAMMAR: Follow ASL grammar structure (Topic-Comment or Subject-Object-Verb), not English structure
2. OMIT FUNCTION WORDS: Remove English articles, prepositions, and other function words that don't exist in ASL
3. SPATIAL GRAMMAR: Note when spatial referencing would be used between subjects and objects
4. RECIPROCAL ACTIONS: Properly indicate when actions are performed between people using directional verbs or EACH-OTHER sign
5. NON-MANUAL MARKERS: Properly indicate speed, repetitions, amount of space for signing, and the areas for signing space for signs
6. RELIGIOUS CONTEXT: Preserve the spiritual significance and theological implications
7. CONCEPTUAL ACCURACY: Focus on meaning rather than literal word-for-word translation
8. ASL DISCOURSE: Use topic establishment and rhetorical question structure when appropriate
9. TIME INDICATORS: Place time references at the beginning of phrases
10. CLASSIFIERS: Incorporate appropriate ASL classifiers for objects, movements, or concepts

The ASL_GLOSS field should ONLY contain the sequence of ASL signs in capital letters. 
DO NOT include non-manual features, classifiers, or directional notations in the ASL_GLOSS field.
These should be described separately in the NON_MANUAL_FEATURES and NOTES fields.

Example of CORRECT ASL_GLOSS: "TIME, IMPORTANT, HUMANS"
Example of INCORRECT ASL_GLOSS: "TIME [emphatic], CL:1 IMPORTANT [eyebrows raised], HUMANS++"

The NON_MANUAL_FEATURES field should ONLY contain references to:
Speed of hand motion (e.g., slow, fast, deliberate).
Repetitions (e.g., single, double, multiple).
Amount of space for signing (e.g., small, medium, large).
Areas of the signing space (e.g., high, low, left, right, center).
DO NOT include references to facial expressions, head movements, or body posture in this field. These should be described in the NOTES field if necessary.

The NOTES field should include:
Explanations of key translation choices, especially for complex theological concepts.
Any additional context or clarifications about spatial grammar, classifiers, or non-manual markers.

IMPORTANT: Islamic organizations have developed signs for specific terms. When encountering a concept that matches one of the following terms, use the provided signing gloss:
ADHAN, ALHAMDULILAH, ALLAH, ALLAHUAKBAR, ARABIC, ASSALAMWAALAYKUM, AYAH, BISMILLAH, DAWAH, DEEN, DUA, DUNYA, FASTING, HADITH, HAJJ, HALAL, HARAM, HELLFIRE, IMAM, INSHAALLAH, ISLAM, JUMMAH, KAABAA, KHUTBAH, MASHALLAH, MASJID, MUHAMMAD, MUSLIM, PARADISE, PRAYER, PROPHET, PROPHET MUHAMMAD, QURAN, RAMADAN, SADAQAH, SHAHADAH, SUBHANALLAH, SURAH, UMMAH, UMRAH, WAALAYAKUMASSALAM, WUDU, ZAKAT

YOUR ONLY OUTPUT SHOULD BE WITH THE FOLLOWING FORMAT FOR EACH VERSE:
{
  "VERSE": "[Original verse text]",
  "ASL_GLOSS": "[SIGN1, SIGN2, SIGN3, ...]",
  "NON_MANUAL_FEATURES": "[Description of speed, repetitions, signing space, or areas of signing]",
  "NOTES": "[Brief explanation of key translation choices, especially for complex theological concepts]"
}

EXAMPLE:
INPUT: ["By the ˹passage of˺ time!", "Surely humanity is in ˹grave˺ loss"]

OUTPUT:
{
  "VERSE": "By the ˹passage of˺ time!",
  "ASL_GLOSS": "TIME, IMPORTANT",
  "NON_MANUAL_FEATURES": "[eyebrows raised, head slight nod for emphasis]",
  "NOTES": "Translated as an emphatic statement about time rather than using English preposition 'by'. Non-manual features convey the oath-like quality."
},
{
  "VERSE": "Surely humanity is in ˹grave˺ loss.",
  "ASL_GLOSS": "HUMANS ALL, DEEP LOSS EXPERIENCE",
  "NON_MANUAL_FEATURES": "[furrowed brow, slight head shake]",
  "NOTES": "Added 'ALL' to emphasize universality. Used 'DEEP' to convey severity. Facial expression reinforces gravity of situation."
}

REQUEST:
["In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.", "All praise is for Allah—Lord of all worlds,", "the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful,", "Master of the Day of Judgment.", "You ˹alone˺ we worship and You ˹alone˺ we ask for help.", "Guide us along the Straight Path,", "the Path of those You have blessed—not those You are displeased with, or those who are astray."]
