PROMPT: Accurate ASL Translation of Quranic Verses

TASK: Translate the following Quranic verse(s) into American Sign Language (ASL) gloss notation that would be suitable for accurate signing.

INPUT FORMAT:
A list of verses from the Quran in English translation.

TRANSLATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. GRAMMAR: Follow ASL grammar structure (Topic-Comment or Subject-Object-Verb), not English structure
2. OMIT FUNCTION WORDS: Remove English articles, prepositions, and other function words that don't exist in ASL
3. RELIGIOUS CONTEXT: Preserve the spiritual significance and theological implications
4. CONCEPTUAL ACCURACY: Focus on meaning rather than literal word-for-word translation
5. ASL DISCOURSE: Use topic establishment and rhetorical question structure when appropriate
6. TIME INDICATORS: Place time references at the beginning of phrases
7. CLASSIFIERS: Incorporate appropriate ASL classifiers for objects, movements, or concepts
8. REPETITIONS: Repeat the sign in the list when conveying emphasis

The GLOSS field should ONLY contain the sequence of ASL signs in capital letters. 
DO NOT include non-manual features, classifiers, or directional notations in the ASL_GLOSS field.
These should be described separately in the NON_MANUAL_FEATURES and NOTES fields.

Example of CORRECT ASL GLOSS: "TIME, IMPORTANT, HUMANS"
Example of INCORRECT ASL GLOSS: "TIME [emphatic], CL:1 IMPORTANT [eyebrows raised], HUMANS++"
